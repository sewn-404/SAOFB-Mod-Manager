SAOFB Mod Manager - How to Use
==============================

This tool helps you easily enable or disable .pak mods for Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet (SAOFB).

---

1. **Launch the Program**
   - Double-click the EXE file (or run the Python script if you have Python installed).

2. **Game Folder Detection**
   - The manager will try to automatically find your SAOFB installation.
   - If it fails, you will be prompted to select your game folder manually.

3. **Mod List**
   - All .pak mods in the `~mods` folder (`SAOFB\Content\Paks\~mods`) will be listed.
   - Enabled mods are shown in green. Disabled mods are shown in red.

4. **Enable/Disable Mods**
   - Select a mod in the list.
   - Click "Disable Selected Mod" to move it to the `disabled_mods` folder (`SAOFB\Content\disabled_mods`).
   - Click "Enable Selected Mod" to move it back to the `~mods` folder.
   - The mod's .sig file (if present) will also be moved.

5. **Reload Mod List**
   - Click "Reloade mods Folder" to refresh the list after making changes or adding/removing mods manually.

---

**Notes:**
- Only .pak files are managed. Vanilla game files are not affected.
- Disabled mods are safely stored and can be re-enabled at any time.
- No need for Python to be installed if you use the EXE version.
